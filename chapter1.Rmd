# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your github repository here. This is an R markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R markdown syntax. See the 'Useful links' page in the mooc area (chapter 1) for instructions.*

**This course seems interesting!** It is good that we have every week these challenging assignments encouraging us to *learn and practice* the use of the R programming language.
